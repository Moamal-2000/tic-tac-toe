        The <strong>Swap</strong> power-up allows you to{" "}
        <strong>exchange the positions </strong> of any{" "}
        <strong>two existing symbols</strong> on the board. This power-up is
        only active when <strong>two occupied squares</strong> are selected; it
        cannot be used if you choose an <strong>empty square</strong>. Utilize
        this power-up to instantly disrupt your opponent's almost-complete
        winning lines, or to immediately form your own winning combination!

        break the opponentâ€™s setup and possibly set up a winning line of their
        own. The <strong>Swap</strong> power-up can even exchange symbols that
        are frozen, making it a powerful tool to turn the tide of the game.
